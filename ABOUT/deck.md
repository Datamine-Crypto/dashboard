Datamine Nework: On-Chain Immutable AI-Powered Decentralized Venture Firm Funding Pitch v1.1:



I want you to create a pitch in PDF format for venture capital firm regarding Datamine Network's newest token: Lockquidity

This pitch will go out to blockchain venture capital companies so please make it sound very professional. We're very professional at Datamine Network and believe in a secure and civil community.

Make the deck visually appealing using the color palette from Datamine Network. Make it super fancy, we want to be cutting-edge Web3 

I want there to be something very unique to this pitch, our target is decentralized venture companies. We are not looking for any venture firm, we want someone that understands blockchain technologies and Web3. 

We're not looking for funding just to give venture firms a "slice of the pie". There is no pie here, everything is decentralized. That's why it's so hard to get funding for our project is because "there is no company". 

It's a decentralized smart contract system meaning there is no single point of faulre such as "a company". So we have to create new innovative ways to raise liquidity.

We love our community members, they've stuck around with us for so long and honestly decentralization of our level is impossible without them, honestly thank you guys.  We probably posted hundreds of development updates and announcements over the years.

So we are looking for funding? Yeah, how much do you need? Hmmm at time of writing this, we currently have $58,340 in decentralized liquidity. So you can imagine we're looking for some fairly small liquidity providers.

We haven't had an investor in the past 5 years but I believe it's a good time to look for one to showcase how far we've come.

Oh there is so much to talk about here, look we've launched back in June 08, 2020. One of the most stressful days in my life.

Also it's kind of crazy that I have to explain this to AI. "Hello Mr. AI, please write this crazy pitch for me". And the crazy part is that the pitch is probably the best pitch in the world.

Before imagine you need a team of marketing and design guys and I can just ask AI to replace all of that in just this one long text.

Where do we start? We've been working on our DeFi project for over 5 years now so there is so much to talk about.

Datamine FLUX is one of the tokens we've launched back in June 08, 2020. It's a really cool idea on solving inflation. So yeah we believe to have solved one of the toughest problems in the world and are trying to prove it.

And we have all the data, numbers, metrics, analytics you could ever dream of. I've attached over 30 real-time data points in this pitch.


If your venture capital firm is interested please inquire to dev@datamine.network. We can discuss how liquidity could be supplied to our decentralized smart contract such as Uniswap liquidity providers to generate yield off our unique transaction-incentivized liquidity pools.

There is so much to discuss let's include some numbers!

All of these numbers below are on-chain, immutable and proven facts. All of our metrics are realtime. 

That's right, all of our data is visible to everyone and there are no unanswered questions.

Some metrics to highlight:

- 5 years uptime and developer commitment

- Over $50,000 in decentralized liquidity
- Unique audited smart-contract with an awesome whitepaper that explains how we solve inflation through incentivized burning
- 158 active users.

Look you probably get a million pitches about random AI startups and endless startup ideas, but we have something truly unique. A decentralized monetary system, how do you actually ask for funding if no one is in charge of it?

It's weird, but that's where we stand out. For 5 years it's been all about metrics, data and understand just what we've created.

The concent of the ecosystem is straight-forward: get tokens for your time by providing liquidity, increase number of tokens by providing more liquidity

Liquidity is king and that's why we've just launched Lockquidity token.

In our ecosystem there are 4 tokens in total but they all serve very unique purposes.

The one I want you to focus on is Lockquidity. It has a permanent liquidity pool where currently we have $17,000 in liquidity with a market cap of $17,000. That's right 100% of the supply is currently in liquidity, crazy numbers.

Look I don't really know how to explain everything to one person without it sounding like I am nuts. This is crazy. I have been working on this project for 5 years and I am talking to AI about funding.

"Oh my god we need liquidity", sometimes I honestly think "Hey even $1000 would be kind of cool if someone could provide that liquidity without taking it out a year later".

"LIQUIDITY". Oh my god, that's been on my mind for the past 5 years. It's hard out here for a blockchain startup when there is so little of it right now.

So yeah, if your firm is interested and you want to be a liquidity provider please reach out to dev@datamine.network. We want to partner with someone that understands our needs.

I've also attached a bunch of metrics for you to uses in this pitch.
