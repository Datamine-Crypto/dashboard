Datamine Nework: On-Chain Immutable AI-Powered Decentralized Venture Firm Funding Pitch v1.1:



I want you to create a pitch in PDF format for venture capital firm regarding Datamine Network's newest token: Lockquidity

This pitch will go out to blockchain venture capital companies so please make it sound very professional. We're very professional at Datamine Network and believe in a secure and civil community.

Make the deck visually appealing using the color palette from Datamine Network. Make it super fancy, we want to be cutting-edge Web3 

I want there to be something very unique to this pitch, our target is decentralized venture companies. We are not looking for any venture firm, we want someone that understands blockchain technologies and Web3. 

We're not looking for funding just to give venture firms a "slice of the pie". There is no pie here, everything is decentralized. That's why it's so hard to get funding for our project is because "there is no company". 

It's a decentralized smart contract system meaning there is no single point of faulre such as "a company". So we have to create new innovative ways to raise liquidity.

We love our community members, they've stuck around with us for so long and honestly decentralization of our level is impossible without them, honestly thank you guys.  We probably posted hundreds of development updates and announcements over the years.

So we are looking for funding? Yeah, how much do you need? Hmmm at time of writing this, we currently have $58,340 in decentralized liquidity. So you can imagine we're looking for some fairly small liquidity providers.

We haven't had an investor in the past 5 years but I believe it's a good time to look for one to showcase how far we've come.

Oh there is so much to talk about here, look we've launched back in June 08, 2020. One of the most stressful days in my life.

Also it's kind of crazy that I have to explain this to AI. "Hello Mr. AI, please write this crazy pitch for me". And the crazy part is that the pitch is probably the best pitch in the world.

Before imagine you need a team of marketing and design guys and I can just ask AI to replace all of that in just this one long text.

Where do we start? We've been working on our DeFi project for over 5 years now so there is so much to talk about.

Datamine FLUX is one of the tokens we've launched back in June 08, 2020. It's a really cool idea on solving inflation. So yeah we believe to have solved one of the toughest problems in the world and are trying to prove it.

And we have all the data, numbers, metrics, analytics you could ever dream of. I've attached over 30 real-time data points in this pitch.


If your venture capital firm is interested please inquire to dev@datamine.network. We can discuss how liquidity could be supplied to our decentralized smart contract such as Uniswap liquidity providers to generate yield off our unique transaction-incentivized liquidity pools.

There is so much to discuss let's include some numbers!

All of these numbers below are on-chain, immutable and proven facts. All of our metrics are realtime. 

That's right, all of our data is visible to everyone and there are no unanswered questions.

Some metrics to highlight:

- 5 years uptime and developer commitment
- Over $50,000 in decentralized liquidity
- Unique audited smart-contract with an awesome whitepaper that explains how we solve inflation through incentivized burning
- 158 active users.

Look you probably get a million pitches about random AI startups and endless startup ideas, but we have something truly unique. A decentralized monetary system, how do you actually ask for funding if no one is in charge of it?

It's weird, but that's where we stand out. For 5 years it's been all about metrics, data and understand just what we've created.

The concent of the ecosystem is straight-forward: get tokens for your time by providing liquidity, increase number of tokens by providing more liquidity

Liquidity is king and that's why we've just launched Lockquidity token.

In our ecosystem there are 4 tokens in total but they all serve very unique purposes.

The one I want you to focus on is Lockquidity. It has a permanent liquidity pool where currently we have $27,000 in liquidity with a market cap of $27,000. That's right 100% of the supply is currently in liquidity, crazy numbers.

Look I don't really know how to explain everything to one person without it sounding like I am nuts. This is crazy. I have been working on this project for 5 years and I am talking to AI about funding.

"Oh my god we need liquidity", sometimes I honestly think "Hey even $1000 would be kind of cool if someone could provide that liquidity without taking it out a year later".

"LIQUIDITY". Oh my god, that's been on my mind for the past 5 years. It's hard out here for a blockchain startup when there is so little of it right now.

So yeah, if your firm is interested and you want to be a liquidity provider please reach out to dev@datamine.network. We want to partner with someone that understands our needs.

I've also attached a bunch of metrics for you to uses in this pitch.

Here is some more explanation on how the ecosystem works, please remove any dollar signs when talking about tokens (EX: $DAM will beocome DAM)


Welcome to the Datamine Network! üåê
If you're new here, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîwe‚Äôve got you covered! 
Datamine Network is a decentralized system designed to:
‚úì Manage Inflation: Keeps token supply balanced to maintain value.
‚úì Promote Stability: Reduces market swings and increases liquidity.
‚úì Reward Participation: Offers incentives for contributing to the ecosystem.
Our ecosystem revolves around four tokens‚Äî$DAM, $FLUX, $ArbiFLUX, and $LOCK‚Äîeach playing a unique role. 
Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step:
Û†Ä†
1Ô∏è‚É£  DAM: The Foundation Token
‚úì Role: DAM anchors the system and has a capped supply of 16,876,779 tokens.
‚úì Use: Lock DAM on Layer 1 (Ethereum) to mint FLUX, which drives participation and value stability.
Û†Ä†
2Ô∏è‚É£  FLUX: The Layer 1 Utility Token
‚úì Role: FLUX is minted when DAM is locked. It‚Äôs used for rewards and transactions.
‚úì Use: Validators can burn FLUX to boost minting rewards and reduce its supply. FLUX can also be bridged to Layer 2, where it can be locked to create ArbiFLUX.
Û†Ä†
3Ô∏è‚É£  ArbiFLUX: The Layer 2 Efficiency Token
‚úì Role: ArbiFLUX operates on Arbitrum (Layer 2) and is created by locking FLUX.
 ‚úì Use: Lower Costs & Faster Transactions: Designed for scalability and efficiency. Validators can burn ArbiFLUX to boost minting rewards on Layer 2, or lock ArbiFLUX to create LOCK.
Û†Ä†
4Ô∏è‚É£  LOCK: The Stability and Liquidity Token
‚úì Role: LOCK enhances stability by contributing to a permanent liquidity pool.
‚úì Use: Minted by locking ArbiFLUX. Can also be burned, but instead of reducing supply, this redirects value to the liquidity pool, ensuring long-term stability.
üîÑ  Integration Flow
‚òëÔ∏è  Locking & Minting:
Lock DAM to mint FLUX (Layer 1).
Transfer FLUX to Layer 2 and lock it to mint ArbiFLUX.
Lock ArbiFLUX to mint LOCK.
‚òëÔ∏è  Burning & Rewards: Validators can burn FLUX, ArbiFLUX, or LOCK to boost minting rewards (APY), reduce supply, and stabilize the system.
 
‚òëÔ∏è  Liquidity & Stability: LOCK ensures market stability by contributing to a permanent liquidity pool, mitigating price swings and increasing depth.
‚òëÔ∏è  Dynamic Monetary Policy: Tokens interact dynamically, balancing inflation and deflation to adapt to market conditions. 
Û†Ä†
üí™  Why Join Datamine?
‚ú≠ Hedge Against Inflation: Dynamic tokenomics adjust supply and demand to preserve purchasing power and stabilize value.
‚ú≠ Generate Yield: Validators and participants are rewarded for locking and burning tokens, driving efficient ecosystem participation.
‚ú≠ Enhance Market Resilience: The permanent liquidity pool strengthens market depth, reducing volatility and supporting sustainable growth.


I will also attach a number of charts over time that will help you gather all the data you need.

- marketCap.png shows market cap of different tokens over time
- availableLiquidity.png shows how much liquidity is currently available
- prices.png is a chart that shows different prices for our tokens over time
- percentageBurned.png shows how percent of all tokens burned over time. These percentages vary based on market conditions, you can correlate this with price data if you want
- yearlySupplyInflation.png shows average 31 day supply inflation for each token. You will find this correlates to price/available liquidity data
- fluxSupplyBreakdown.png shows how the FLUX supply is broken out over time. This diagram goes over 100% because such a large percentage of supply was burned and the percentages are based off CURRENT supply.
- fluxData.png shows remaining supply of FLUX, burned FLUX supply and how many validators are active vs total. The total validators includes dormant validators which have not minted in over 3 years
- dcpi.png is our take on "Decentralized Consumer Price Index". If you compare this to other currencies you will see that our price index actually goes down not just up like other currencie which proves our monetary system works
- globalUnmintedAmount.png shows a dollar value for current unminted amounts for each token
- monthlyProduction.png shows how much in dollar value of each token is produced. This is of course basded on the price and it's the potential "market pressure" which is why liquidity is so important. As you can see there is a lot of monthly pressure compared to liquidity.
- activeValidators.png shows total number of users that are participating in minting across different tokens. You will see FLUX active validators dropped because of high gas fees
- fluxOnL2.png shows how much of FLUX (which is minted on L1) is now on Arbitrum L2 (most likely either minting ArbiFLUX or in the Uniswap L2 liquidity pool). Most of FLUX lives on L2.
- percentagePoweringValidators.png shows how much of each token is locked-in to mint their respective tokens (ex: DAM mints FLUX, FLUX mints ArbiFLUX, ArbiFLUX mints LOCK)

// 2025-04-06 update:

I want to introduce a new metric called "Market Efficiency" for Lockquidity, here is how it will work:

I've attached a price of ETH/LOCK in our liquidity pool on 2025-04-06 (ethLockPool.png)

I want to explain why the stability of the pool is so important. "Put your ETH to work, convert ETH to Lockquidity" should be the main point.

I want people to understand that burning LOCK is better than just holding ETH.

In traditional finance: "buy LOW, sell HIGH" in our monetary ecosystem: "burn LOW, sell HIGH"

First of all, this is a brand new asset class. 

* Best of both worlds: price stability due to having large % of liquidity in the pool
* Volatility of ETH: since the liquidity pool is 100% ETH, we mirror the performance (both up and down) of ETH. However with LOCK if the price of ETH goes down the burning incentives increase (Burn LOW, Sell HIGH)

Currently we're starting to see the liquidity pool slowly stray away from 100% of liquidity being located in the liquidity pool. This is CRITICAL in proving that fresh, new liquidity for validators is coming from the markets!

The higher that % of LOCK that is outside of the liquidity pool, the better the incentives are for burning LOCK.

Currently 97.93% of the LOCK is inside the market, we will use this as a new metric: "Market Efficiency". 100%-97.93% = 2.07% market efficiency.

The closer we get to 100% market efficiency, the more trading volatility is expected and the validators win the most as trader liquidity is recycled back as permanent liquidity.

As inflation is rapidly decreasing and the market efficiency is increasing we'll see Lockquidity ecosystem truly shine for the first time.

Lockquidity is it's own asset class and it will perform unlike any other class in the world. Lockquidity = king.

// 2025-05-02 Update:

Eventually the liquidity pool for Lockquidity will no longer have 100% liquidity inside of it. This will happen when traders come. When this happens the following occurs:

Liquidity that was used to purchase LOCK will now be slowly re-added back to the liquidity pool by the validators. They will burn LOCK like usual, which will increase the LOCK supply in the pool, but the ETH will stay in the pool.
The LOCK that was purchased will lose a tiny bit of value due to the small inflation from the validators. While this seems bad for anyone that purchases LOCK, the amount of loss would be very minor, much less than monetary inflation in a traditional system.
The actual amount of LOCK that would be lost to inflation from validators would be less and less (as the supply increases the inflation lowers)
3. If the LOCK is sold back on the market, the amount of ETH in the pool slightly increases due to the small inflation.
4. The more LOCK is outside of the pool, the more value the validators add back to the pool. That means they are adding back more ETH as permanent liquidity.
5. As more LOCK is outside of the ecosystem buying and burning LOCK means your buys have more volatility. With 100% of LOCK in the pool your volatility is as low as possible because you're getting the best bang for the buck.

Overall as more traders come we will get further away from 100% liquidity in the pool, but at the same time that also means the value of LOCK goes up and the interest from traders grows. 

The closer we are to 100% liquidity, the more value traders would get when buying LOCK.

I think the biggest point of Lockquidity is that it allows you to not worry about "when to sell ETH" since you can sell your mints slowly overtime.

This means "just holding ETH" is not as efficient as you never know when to sell it.

Additionally there is no asset in the world that has the yield and growth potential combined together like Lockquidity.

Can we tie-in "dollar-cost averaging" here into our messaging here? You could slowly mint and sell your LOCK rather than trying to time ETH tops.

Lockquidity is both "Yield and Growth" asset which is the best of both worlds.

- Yield comes from burning and generating LOCK.
- Growth comes from ETH volatility and trading fees in the liquidity pool. As well as growth will eventually come from traders buying LOCK.

This is where we introduce Datmaine Market: Decentralized "Time-in-market" solution

Imagine if there was a button that anyone in the world can click that turns 100 LOCK into 105 LOCk instantly, guaranteed. Would you click this button?

Everytime you click this button, you get +5 LOCK. If 5 LOCK = $0.01 then you are now making $0.01 click.

What if 5 LOCK = $10, would you click a button to make $10? We believe the answer is, if such a button existed then someone in the world would click it.

This is where Datamine Market comes in. It's our revolutionary way to decentarlize "Time-in-market" and create true decentralized demand in our ecosystem.

Imagine when starting your validator you can instead ask public to click your mint button. "I will pay you 5% to burn any amount of LOCK to me that I can already mint"

Meaning if you have $210 in unminted balance, imagine someone would say "I'll burn $200 worth of tokens to your address if you give me back $210 right away"

This would be very benefitial to the validator because the APY they get long term is worth way more than 5% that they had to pay initially.

This means a random person in the world can instantly get $10 worth of value in LOCK!

Now if hundreds of validators enable public market minting we'll have a true decentralized market of APY! "How much is your time in market worth? 5%? 10%? etc."

The beauty of our market is that it's a completely decentralized smart contract. That means no one is in control of this market and it's backed by Ethereum security.

Validators can specify what reward % they are offering for someone to come and burn to their account. Want someone to burn to your account? Simply adjust your reward percentage accordingly.

More details of how Datamine market works:
- Validators offer their 105% of their unmited FLUX in exchange for 100% of someone burning to their account
- This happens seamlessly in a single ethereum transaction with a single button click through a smart contract
- This forces "Market Efficiency" metric to go up as tokens are stored in the market smart contract
- The more lucrative the rewards are the more transactions we get.
- Theoretical cap for this new feature is 7200 transactions per validator per day (if button is clicked once every 12 seconds due to Ethereum block timing).
- Every market rewards collection transaction adds a burn+add liquidity through the liquidity pool for the amount burned
- Internally we're using delegated partial burning to get increased minting efficiency. Meaning if you have $200 in unminted balance and someone burns $10, only $10.50 of amount is minted back to burner
- Launching on Lockquidity first, but will also be deployed for FLUX and ArbiFLUX providing new utility for those tokens
- Tokens are deposited into a smart contract where they can be spent for burning. Rewards are accumilated and can be collected at any time through a withdraw button without any additional fees
- Rewards and rules (such as min amount of tokens that can be burned, duration) can be tweaked in realtime allowing for a more dynamic market

This is where Datamine Gems #GameFi comes in. "Gaming + Finance", the ultimate combo.

We've gotten to a point where we just created the greatest game of all time: 
- It's real-time 
- anyone anywhere in the world can play
- It's anonymous
- It's low gas
- Barrier to entry is only
- It's mobile-friendly
- The ultimate goal: be the fastest and the least-greedy person in the world.

We created a new smart contract that can mint from multiple addresses autonomously. Meaning we can collect rewards from multiple 

"Why are we doing this efficiency update?" Because we are trying to increase our monetary velocity.

The most efficient and understandble the UI/UX is for the minting is the higher transactional throughput we get.

This means increased stability in inflation % as total unminted tokens remain low.

The more transactions we can get the better the rewards are for validators as they get a constant stream of increased APY %.

The new Datamine Gems features a new "Version 2" of our Public Market smart contract

The new public market smart contract features:

- Burning tokens before reward distribution for new game theory concepts
- Atoomic Batch burning from multiple addresses for even greater throughput
- Automatic minting to latest Ethereum block for maximum rewards
- Automatic amount prefilling to get highest rewards
- Optional custom burn amount (ex: Users can burn 1000 tokens if you have 700 unminted and 300 in your market balance)
- Even more optimized rewards distribution

Datamine Gems comes with a set of prefilled addresses in the decentralzed dashboard. You are presented with a set of diamonds where each dimond = public market address.

Each gem is unminted $ amount. The bigger the unminted $ the bigger/different color the gems are. Users can customize these gem colors as they see fit.

Addresses can be added to the game field as new gems (for any non-default addresses)

Default addresses will be decided by the community based on burning participation/stability of the validator (ex: if address pauses minting they will be excluded from default addresses)

Here is how the game works:
- As each gem grows in $ it gets more prominent on the page.
- It's in realtime so you can monitor all your gems in one place.
- It's tracked in your browser so you can see total gems/$ you collected
- It works without going to liquidity dashboard
- It uses new V2 contract which is even more efficient as it does burn before distributing rewards
- We added new "Atomic Multi-Address burning" so you will be able to collect multiple gems in 1 transaction (coming soon)
