### Datamine Market (Decentralized "Time-in-market" solution)

A revolutionary approach to decentralize "Time-in-market" and create true decentralized demand. Validators can offer a percentage reward for others to burn LOCK to their account, effectively decentralizing demand and increasing market efficiency. This process is seamlessly executed in a single Ethereum transaction.

### Datamine Gems #GameFi

A real-time game where users collect "gems" (public market addresses with unminted balances) by burning tokens. It features a new V2 Public Market smart contract for even greater throughput, atomic batch burning from multiple addresses, and optimized reward distribution. A "Collect all gems" button allows for single-transaction collection from multiple addresses, aiming to increase monetary velocity and transactional throughput.

### LOCK (Lockquidity) Token

Our newest token, LOCK, is designed to enhance stability by contributing to a permanent liquidity pool. It is minted by locking ArbiFLUX. Uniquely, burning LOCK redirects value to the liquidity pool instead of reducing supply, ensuring long-term stability. A new metric, "Market Efficiency," is introduced, defined as 100% minus the percentage of LOCK inside the market. Higher market efficiency indicates more trading volatility and benefits validators.

### Core Values & Ecosystem Principles

The Datamine Network is built on core values that drive its unique approach to DeFi:

- **Transaction-incentivized Liquidity Pools:** DAM and FLUX offer unique incentives for providing liquidity on Uniswap & Balancer pools, ensuring constant token movement.
- **On-Chain Linear Deflation:** FLUX supply is non-fixed and features predictable deflation through a burning mechanism, with its generation tied to DAM staking.
- **Realtime Multi-Smart Contract Analytics:** The dashboard provides real-time on-chain market sentiment, balances in USD, and analytics through deep Uniswap integration.
- **Secure By Design & Professionally Audited:** All business logic is executed via audited smart contracts, ensuring fund safety and security without third-party involvement.
- **Built For The Community:** Utilizes serverless, web3, and mobile technologies for a seamless and secure user experience.
- **Global Problem Solved:** The Datamine Ecosystem aims to solve inflation through its deflationary tokenomics and on-chain demand generation.

### Token Specifications & Mechanics

The ecosystem comprises several tokens with distinct roles and mechanics:

- **DAM (Datamine Token):** Fixed supply (16,876,778 tokens), ERC-777 standard, primarily used for staking to power validators.
- **FLUX (Flux Token):** Non-fixed supply, base currency of the ecosystem, features linear and predictable deflation through burning.
- **Validator (Mint Start/Stop):** The process of locking DAM tokens to generate FLUX.
- **Delegated Minting:** Allows a different Ethereum address to mint FLUX tokens on behalf of a validator.
- **Remote Minting/Burning:** Features for minting FLUX from a phone to any Ethereum address, and burning FLUX to any address with an active mint.
- **Partial Minting:** Ability to specify a percentage of minting (0-100%) and mint smaller amounts to other addresses.
- **Mint Age Multiplier:** Increases over time (up to 3x after 28 days) for continuous validator operation.
- **Burn Multiplier:** Variable multiplier (up to 10x) based on FLUX burned relative to global averages.

### Smart Contracts - In-Depth Breakdown

The project's smart contracts are the backbone of the Datamine Network, built with a strong emphasis on security and transparency:

- **Technology Stack:** Smart contracts are written in Solidity (v0.6.9) and are ERC-777 compatible, built upon OpenZeppelin secure libraries.
- **Security Features:** Includes SafeMath for arithmetic operations, Mutex and Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern for re-entrancy protection, custom modifiers (`preventSameBlock()`, `requireLocked()`), immutable state variables, and a unique ERC-1820 ERC777TokensRecipient implementation.
- **Core Functions:** Detailed explanation of `lock()`, `unlock()`, `burnToAddress()`, and `mintToAddress()` functions, including their security considerations and how they modify the contract's state.
- **View-Only Functions:** Functions like `getMintAmount()`, `getAddressTimeMultiplier()`, `getAddressBurnMultiplier()`, `getAddressRatio()`, and `getGlobalRatio()` provide real-time analytics without modifying state.
- **Data Aggregation:** Helper functions (`getAddressDetails()`, `getAddressTokenDetails()`) are provided to reduce network calls for dashboard data.
- **Additional Security Considerations (ConsenSys):** Adherence to best practices like preparing for failure, careful rollout, keeping contracts simple, staying up to date, awareness of blockchain properties, and secure development recommendations (external calls, public data, integer handling, assert/require/revert usage, modifiers, rounding, fallback functions, visibility, pragma locking, events, `tx.origin`, timestamp dependence, EIP20 approve/transferFrom attack).

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in development mode.
  Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `yarn deploy`: Creates a production build with a specific base path for deployment.
- `yarn format`: Formats code using Prettier.
- `yarn lint`: Lints the project using ESLint.

### To Deploy

#### `yarn build`

This will create a new build in build/ folder that you can host. We currently host this on github(<https://datamine-crypto.github.io/dashboard/>) for decentralization reasons & proof of builds.

The `homepage` field in `package.json` is set to `.`, which is crucial for GitHub Pages deployments when the site is hosted in a subfolder (e.g., `your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`). This ensures that relative paths for assets are correctly resolved.

The builds can be hosted in subfolders and do not perform external http calls for security & decentralization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

While comprehensive UI testing is valuable, our current focus prioritizes rapid UI experimentation. This approach is informed by:

- **Audited Smart Contracts**: Our core smart contracts have undergone thorough audits (see [`audits folder`](https://github.com/Datamine-Crypto/white-paper/tree/master/audits)), ensuring their reliability and security. This mitigates concerns about the underlying blockchain logic.
- **Direct MetaMask Communication**: The UI primarily communicates directly with MetaMask, acting as a thin client to immutable smart contracts. This reduces the complexity and risk typically associated with backend integrations.

Given these factors, we find it more efficient to iterate quickly on the UI, leveraging the stability of the audited contracts and the direct, secure wallet interaction. Future development may include UI tests as the project matures and UI stability becomes a higher priority.
